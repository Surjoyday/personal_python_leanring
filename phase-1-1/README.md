## Phase 1: Python Fundamentals & Console Applications

**Objective:** To master core Python syntax, data structures, object-oriented principles, and how to interact with external APIs.

### Requirements:

1.  **Environment Setup:**

    - Use `poetry` to initialize a new Python project.
    - Learn how to manage dependencies and run scripts within the `poetry` environment.

2.  **Console Calculator:**

    - Build a command-line calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    - **Iteration 1:** Implement the logic using simple functions.
    - **Iteration 2:** Refactor the code into a `Calculator` class, demonstrating basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

3.  **Testing:**

    - Write unit tests for your calculator's functions using the `pytest` framework.
    - Learn how to run tests and interpret the results.

4.  **API Integration:**
    - Use the `requests` library to make HTTP requests.
    - Create a simple console-based chatbot that:
      - Takes user input from the command line.
      - Sends the input to the OpenAI API.
      - Prints the AI's response back to the console.

### Deliverables:

- A Git repository containing your `poetry`-managed project.
- A working console-based calculator with `pytest` tests.
- A working console-based chatbot that communicates with the OpenAI API.
